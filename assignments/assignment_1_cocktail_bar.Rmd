# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# I was stuck on this first step on how to separate rows correctly as there were many different types of measurements, so I asked ChatGPT, however, I am unsure if there could have been a less complicated way to clean the data.

cocktail_cleaned <- cocktail %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "<[^>]+>", "|")) %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "\\||\\s+or\\s+") %>% 
  mutate(ingredients = ingredients %>% 
           str_remove_all("\\d+\\s*/?\\d*\\s*(oz|drops|tsp|tbsp|bsp|dashes|dash)") %>% 
           str_remove_all("\\([^)]*%.*?\\)") %>% 
           str_remove_all("\\b\\d+\\b") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\b\\d+\\.\\d+\\b") %>%
           str_remove_all("[[:punct:]]") %>%
           str_squish() %>% 
           str_to_lower()
  )
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_list <- cocktail_cleaned %>% 
  distinct(ingredients) %>% 
  arrange(ingredients)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

*A total of 65 ingredients are necessary for the cocktails.*

```{r}
count(ingredients_list)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

*The 10 most common ingredients are: lemon juice, simple syrup, gin, sweet vermouth, angostura bitters, lime juice, saline solution, water, rye, cognac, luxardo maraschino*

```{r}
ingredients_10 <- cocktail_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(ingredients) %>% 
  summarize(n_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_ingredients)) %>% 
  slice_max(n_ingredients, n = 10, with_ties = TRUE)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

*The following cocktails have the most ingredients: Blender Margarita, Carbonated Negroni, Clover Club, De La Louisiane, Pink Lady, Vieux Carre.*

```{r}
cocktail_ingredients <- cocktail_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(n_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_ingredients))

cocktail_most_ingredients <- cocktail_ingredients %>% 
  filter(n_ingredients == 6)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient. 

*There are a total of 25 ingredients that appear in a single cocktail: absinthe, absolute citron vodka, agarclarified grapefruit juice, amer picon, centrifugeclarified grapefruit juice, cherry herring, cranberry juice, crem de violette, demerara syrup, dolin dry vermouth, drambuie, drop saline, fernet branca, heavy cream, hellfire bitters, lairds applejack bottled in bond, luxardo marschino, old tom gin, pisco, quinine simple syrup, sloe gin, sugared proof rum, sugared proof rye, white creme de cacao, white mezcal, simple*

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(ingredients) %>% 
  summarize(n_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  arrange(n_ingredients) %>% 
  filter(n_ingredients == 1) 

# is the ingredient "simple" a mistake? I checke the original data and there wasn't any additional information there so it wasn't accidentally deleted
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

*A total of 21 cocktails have rare ingredients.*

```{r}
ingredient_usage <- cocktail_cleaned %>%
  group_by(ingredients, name) %>%
  summarise(n_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) %>% 
  filter(n() == 1) 

cocktails_rare_ingredients <- cocktail_cleaned %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% ingredient_usage$ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

*There are a total of 34 cocktails on the list with no rare ingredients.*

```{r}
cocktails_with_rare <- cocktail_cleaned %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)

common_ingredients <- cocktail_cleaned %>%
  filter(!name %in% cocktails_with_rare$name) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(n_ingredients = n_distinct(ingredients)) %>%
  filter(n_ingredients > 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_ingredients))
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cocktail_matrix <- cocktail_cleaned %>%
    distinct(name, ingredients)

cocktail <- cocktail_matrix$name
ingredient <- cocktail_matrix$ingredients
values <- rep("X", nrow(cocktail_matrix))

cocktail_cheat_sheet <- matrix("",
                               nrow = length(unique(cocktail)),
                               ncol = length(unique(ingredient)),
                               dimnames = list(sort(unique(cocktail)), sort(unique(ingredient)))
)

for (i in seq_len(nrow(cocktail_matrix))) {
  cocktail_cheat_sheet[cocktail[i], ingredient[i]] <- "X"
}

cocktail_cheat_sheet
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
